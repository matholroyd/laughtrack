<p>So a 10.30 pm start underneath the assembly rooms sees the fabulous Ali McGregor assembling a cast of regulars and some special guests for to give you the entertainment. We are greeted as we enter by the MC Saxon McAlister who is so Aussie, it makes me homesick. He then does the important announcements and introduces us to the delectable Ali.</p>


	<p style="float:right"><img src="/articles/2009/08/09/2009-edinburgh-fringe-reviews/ali-mcgregors-late-nite-variety-nite-night/attachment/Ali%20McGregor.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>Ali gives us her first song using an Omninote (weird instrument from the 80s) and a cover of a cover (parodying Celine Dion and Anastascia destroying as <span class="caps">ACDC</span> classic). After we&#8217;ve recovered from that we have the first guest in Dave Thornton who chats about being in scotland, computers and words. Very funny and if I had time I&#8217;d see his show as well. After this is Tina Del Twist dragging her heels a little. Ali comes back (well, to be honest she never left as she is reclining at the side of the stage on a tiny Chaise Longue) with a stalker song by our very own Kylie which becomes so scary I could hear people shuddering. Awesome is the only word to describe Ali&#8217;s singing, and the use of rolf Harris&#8217; stylophone&#8230;.</p>


	<p>the next act is rather to horrible to mention but suffice to say it is a version of Private dancer as such by saxon that i want seared out of my brain! ali then plays Creep (with a zither) and we have the next guest act in the Pyjama Men. I haven&#8217;t seen these guys before but they hype they have generated I have to say is justified from what I saw them do (and when the toned down punchline is gang rape&#8230;.). Very hard getting these guys off the stage as they were having so much fun. The final act is one I remember from years ago, Paul Zenon and his comedy magic tricks.</p>


	<p>~So for over an hour of comedy music and entertainment (but no dancing girls, curses) this is one of the best value shows at the fringe. Even if you just come to see Ali and buy her CD, or saxon&#8217;s naughty postcards, you&#8217;ll be getting your moneys worth. Different guests every night plus discounted entry into the supper club after make this one not to miss.</p>

 <title>Twelve Angry Sketches</title>

<p>These guys deserve more of an audience. As the title says there are 12 sketches performed by our two stars (as they cruelly described themselves; the tall fatty and the little balding gym junkie). Some of the sketches are OK but some of them border on brilliant. there is a swordfight, some very silly props and an on-stage exorcism. The best sketches for me were the take on Watership Down and the Turner and Hooch retirement scene. there were a few mistakes and some unexpected ad-libs but this may have been explained in the big song finale (sung <span class="caps">VERY</span> badly).</p>


	<p style="float:right"><img src="/articles/2009/08/09/2009-edinburgh-fringe-reviews/twelve-angry-sketches/attachment/Naylor%20and%20Gant.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>Naylor and Gant have a good onscreen rapport and, although the small audience didn&#8217;t laugh out loud many times, there was a good round of applause at the end to show their appreciation. the duo need more people to be there for the jokes to get their proper response and I would urge everyone to come along and see this pair before they do themselves an injury. Plus if enough people buy tickets they may have enough for singing lessons. The show is only 45 minutes and well worth the money.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>Before this show we were given a sheet tell the story that were about to see. Kaguya Hime (moon princess) is one of Japan&#8217;s oldest fairy tales and concerns an old couple (it&#8217;s always an old couple isn&#8217;t it? How old do they mean? no-one is ever in the full of their life in fairy tale land) find a baby girl in a bamboo stalk and take her to raise her as their own. she grew to be a beautiful young lady but rejected all the young men who tried to chat her up, saying she was from the moon and must soon return. Her father (remember, the poor old wood cutter at the start?) now has enough money to hire soldiers to try and stop her leaving but an angel comes and puts them to sleep and takes the princess away.</p>


	<p style="float:right"><img src="/articles/2009/08/09/2009-edinburgh-fringe-reviews/kaguya-hime/attachment/Kaguya%20Hime.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>But enough of that. Once you get in it is hard to find any relation between the show and the story as we have an opening that could be the placement of the moon daughter into the bamboo done in a ballet style with music appearing to be a collaboration between Philip glass and Yoko Ono ) and all done on stage). Next we have three young (tenish) girls come and do a dance with cherry blossoms (time passing), then another ballet, then the three youngsters back for some play and a party. finally there is a conversation between the princess and the angel before she leaves.</p>


	<p>While it all looked very pretty and the girls danced very cutely, the music, while spookily atmospheric, was setting my teeth on edge and I feel it may have been better to have a card with chapters at the start of each section. Still if you just come for some cute youngsters dancing about on stage, then I can definitely recommend this. and considering the number of children in the audience and the few protests from them, it is obviously captivating for the kids.</p>

<p>Most productions (and I&#8217;m talking the TV and film) love to focus on the naughty aspects of Moll Flanders&#8217; life. This show decides to show the full story and the whoring is hardly mentioned. Instead we have a more complete history of the sad and exciting life from Moll&#8217;s birth in the mid-1700&#8217;s in newgate prison, to her finding of her mother at precisely the wrong time, the loss of a husband or two, loving a highwayman, becoming a pickpocket and finally the unlikely happy ending. I still can&#8217;t work out whether Daniel Defoe wrote her as a hero or a victim as, although she is dealt a very bad hand from life, she does manage to triumph in the end but she does have one hell of a struggle.</p>


	<p style="float:right"><img src="/articles/2009/08/09/2009-edinburgh-fringe-reviews/moll-flanders/attachment/Total%20Arts.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>the show started with an announcement that one of the principal cast had had an accident yesterday and a replacement, with one day preparation, would be playing his parts. The stage has a few props including the gallows at the centre rear and, the best touch of all for my liking was, whenever the part only required one or two players on stage, the remainder of the cast did not pop out for a break but formed a tableau around the gallows and froze for the entire period they were not featuring.</p>


	<p>The players in this show were all excellent and the tragic moments almost brought a tear to my eye. The costumes were all sumptuous (from the let&#8217;s wear curtain period of history) and there is little I can say to fault this production. If you love a good rollicking historical drama full of action and soap-opera style story twists, then you must see this show.</p>

<p>Amazing how just donning a lab coat and some protective goggles can make your pronouncements so much more factual. Rosie comes to us with the history of sex, but she got sidetracked on the way by the research and dumped by her girlfriend so it&#8217;s turned into a bit more about relationships and being in love. She also comes equipped with flipcharts, graphs and a large model of a small thing and a small model of a large thing (no telling).</p>


	<p style="float:right"><img src="/articles/2009/08/09/2009-edinburgh-fringe-reviews/rosie-wilby-the-science-of-sex/attachment/Rosie%20Wilby.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>The room is tiny and the first five minutes was spend getting in extra chairs for all the punters with no-where to sit, so it&#8217;s more than selling out. Rosie comes on, asks a few pointed questions of the audience and starts her lecture. We&#8217;re guided through the early days of attraction and gradually work our way up to mix tapes to make love to (and now I can&#8217;t get that bloody la la la la song out of my head).</p>


	<p>Rosie is an friendly and engaging performer and the audience were quite happy to answer her questions and participate in the games. There are a lot of little jokes and amusing stories as the show progresses and it has a lovely sparkly conclusion. So, if you need a way to spark up your relationship or are just looking to see where you&#8217;ve gone wrong in love, this may not have the answers but at least you&#8217;ll see you aren&#8217;t alone. You can even take your mum, as the couple in front of me had, but the discussion about pussy cream and the cupboard full of old tools may mean you never look her in the eye again.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s August and The Edinburgh Fringe Festival is up and running at full strength. This year, as is often the case, a plethora of Australian performers are trying their luck, hoping to be the next big thing (ala Tim Minchin) and perhaps win, whatever it is they&#8217;ve decided to call their Awards this year (I think they are nicknamed &#8216;The Eddies&#8217; this year). There are even more Aussies over there this year, so we wish them all the best of luck and will try to keep up with all that&#8217;s happening. We will print the shortlist for The Eddies that are announced on Aug 26th.
<div style="float:right"><img src="/articles/2009/08/13/australians-in-edinburgh-2009/attachment/aust%20flag.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>This is a showcase of seven US dance companies, each performing one piece in this show. the first piece was a solo female doing a jazzy and very acrobatic slow dance to what I think was a song by Pink Martini. Next was a sort of rap combined with urban dance and some beat poetry about the gangsters and futility of life in the means streets in America (I think). We then had five girls dancing on carpets, a dancer doing some ballet to a French style tune, Something I could only describe as Faceback and Eyebra&#8217;s, a rather strange and scary exorcism (well, that&#8217;s what the audio was telling over and over) and finally a sort of gym class to Taiko drumming.</p>


	<p style="float:right"><img src="/articles/2009/08/09/2009-edinburgh-fringe-reviews/booking-dance-festival/attachment/booking%20dance.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>Now I&#8217;m not a dancer or a devotee of the dance (apart from Fred &#38; Ginger), so I&#8217;m sure much of the significance was lost on me, but the only ones that told a story were the first two and the Exorcism and the only one I really enjoyed was the first one. All the dancers were excellent at what they did, had bodies that made me feel a little ashamed and amazing stamina, but there was very little that I could connect to on the stage. It was mostly meaningless dancing about to my eyes, so I can only recommend this to students of dance or producers looking for a dance group to work with. Plus it wss meant to go for 75 minutes and was finished around 55.</p>

<p>Vicki Ferentinos is from New Jersey. she&#8217;s loud and brash and confident. This is the story of how she broke free from all the mistakes she has made and found her inner superhero. She&#8217;ll take your tickets at the start and even give you a hug if you smile right. Then she&#8217;ll bounce on the stage, explain why the world needs a super hero like her and then trace the Lady Bug Warrior from its beginning to the present day.</p>


	<p style="float:right"><img src="/articles/2009/08/09/2009-edinburgh-fringe-reviews/lady-bug-warrior/attachment/lbw.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>We have her parents, her brother, her boyfriends, bosses, friends and other people who have treated her badly, being played by her and some very amusing costumes. I knew a lot of people like the ones she described, especially the mama&#8217;s boys and psycho bride. Vicki is not afraid to make herself look foolish and we&#8217;re encouraged to forget the embarrasment of life and just enjoy it by the end of the 45 minute show. It&#8217;s got a lot of laughts in for such a short show and if you&#8217;re feeling a little bit down with life, this is the perfect pick-me-up that&#8217;ll have you boogying out of the room (which Vicki also holds open for you as you leave).</p>

 <title>8 1/2 songs about love (and other myths)</title>

<p>Helen Arney is here to share a little about the disaster that has been her love life (though the songs may not be true, unless they are). We have a song about a date that goes a little too far, one about an ex-boyfriend and the revenge exacted upon him a decade later and some others which I won&#8217;t reveal (although a glockenspiel may be used and a piano accordion may be threatened). We also get an extra song written this week in response to a typo in the show title on a website.</p>


	<p style="float:right"><img src="/articles/2009/08/09/2009-edinburgh-fringe-reviews/8-12-songs-about-love-and-other-myths/attachment/Helen%20Arney%20Press2.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>Helen is an engaging person and the small room and intimate atmosphere enable a lovely rapport between performer and audience. She has a nice line in between song banter and everyone in the audience was having a fun time. The show will not appeal to everyone as it&#8217;s more a chatty and pleasantly relaxed show, but if you need a break from the big loud and shouty stuff, then this will warm your heart. and you may even get a badge and some sweeties at the end if you&#8217;re lucky.</p>

<p>This is a show that you can&#8217;t see as the tickets were all snapped up by the locals ages ago (I know as Fred asked where everyone was from before the start and there were, I think, four non-scots in the audience). The show is broadcast live on <span class="caps">BBC</span> Scotland from 10 to 11.30 am and available to listen again for the next week on the internet.</p>


	<p style="float:right"><img src="/articles/2009/08/09/2009-edinburgh-fringe-reviews/macaulay-and-co/attachment/fred.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>Todays guests were, in order, Russell Kane and partner Sadie performing a short excerpt from Fakespeare before having a char with fred; Doc Brown doing an Archers&#8217; rap; Wit Tank with a indepth look at teachers; Tom Basden with a couple of little songlets; at this point the girl next to me collapsed (festival flu?) and was very sick but she didn&#8217;t make much noise and we were able to get help for her without interrupting the broadcast; Brian Gittins with some &#8216;jokes&#8217;; the big chat with Marcus Brigstock, Jason Byrne and Justin Moorhouse and an extra bit from Mr Gittins to close the show.</p>


	<p>So, ninety minutes of comedy and chat with a little drama thrown in. Excellent comedy and all for free. mind you the <span class="caps">RBS</span> manager (behind me) who got tickets for about 10 of his clients appears the man to chat up if you want to get in. See it if you can, listen on the radio or internet if you&#8217;re just not lucky enough. And finally I heard some good jokes about the bloody tramworks that are diggin up every second street in the town and I think it was before the broadcast. Sorry.</p>

<p>I knew nothing about Muriel Spark (the author) prior to this show. Apparently this and the Prime of Miss Jean Brodie are classics and much loved by her fans, dealing with the era of post war rationing and the proper education of  young girls.</p>


	<p style="float:right"><img src="/articles/2009/08/09/2009-edinburgh-fringe-reviews/the-girls-of-slender-means/attachment/The%20Girls%20of%20Slender%20Means.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>The story in this play is set in two different times, the first at the end of the second world war and the second six years later. confusingly the two periods are mixed together and there is a date projected onto a screenadvising when the later scenes are being shown. Sadly, the screens can only be clearly seen from the centre thirdof the audience and those of us on the sides miss out of a lot of visual detail. the stage is used to the full with the aforementioned screens being moved around to create walls doors, filmscreens and other more ephemeral barriers, but is only fully accessible for those in the centre section of the theatre.</p>


	<p>The cast of the play do an excellent job with the story of a young girl coming down from scotland to join a girls hostel at the end of the second world war (the slender means refers both to the rationing of food and material due to the war and the financial situation of the young ladies being portrayed here). The hostel is an old building abutting a secret military establishment. the military personnel socialise with the girls and one young man in particular becomes a very close friend to them. When tragedy strikes at the end of the play, we see what happens to the man ( his fate is revealed at the start but the reasons only become clear at the end if you get what I mean).</p>


	<p>I was confused about events for the first part of the show but it all became clear and, as a whole, it is a funny and sad look at a time that touched so many. Well worth the effort if you need a good tearjerker with some humour and romance.</p>

 <title>Tao - Samurai Magical Drumming</title>

<p>OK, so I thought this was going to be a smallish affair and I&#8217;d have time for a coffee at the venue before the show. NO! i got there 30 minutes before the start and there were at least 400 of the 500 audience member already queueing in front of me. So if you want a good seat down the front, I&#8217;d suggest arriving at about lunchtime!</p>


	<p style="float:right"><img src="/articles/2009/08/09/2009-edinburgh-fringe-reviews/tao---samurai-magical-drumming/attachment/Tao%20Druming.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>The troupe Tao is from Japan, formed in 1993 and first performed overseas in 2004 at the Edinburgh Fringe. They now spend over half the year performing around the world. Taiko drumming is a traditional art/religious form in Japan.</p>


	<p>The show is a spectacular series of drumming (with flute accompaniment plus a few other instruments). There are 11 people in the cast of the show (3 female) and all get a chance at the front stage. The amount of drums used in this show is staggering and I&#8217;d hate to think of their excess baggage costs. The two huge drums at the back stayed for the whole show and there were dozens rolled out for each piece.</p>


	<p>The fire and energy of the performers was amazing as they played their instruments and raced about on the stage. The instrument changes were smooth with hardly a break between pieces. The playing was excellent and the audience gave them a standing ovation at the end of the show. Anyone else consider it a little strange that we thank a percussion group by clapping? Just me? Oh well.</p>


	<p>So if you love drumming and want to see an excellent and powerful show, I can definitely recommend this. You can also buy CD&#8217;s (£15) and DVDs (£20) after the show and even have them signed by one of the cast. I&#8217;d suggest this is a good idea or they&#8217;ll never be able to get the plane fares back to japan.</p>

<p>Laura Solon is an exceptional talent. In this show she tells the story of a publising assistant who has to write the final chapter of a murder story by the weekend or the company will fold and she may end up stuffed on a mantelpiece. She plays all the parts in the show including two publishing company moguls (one called Black and the other a shady Russian &#8211; but they&#8217;re not based on anyone in real life, surely), the literary agent, a bunch of mad authors and a few unusual workmates.</p>


	<p style="float:right"><img src="/articles/2009/08/09/2009-edinburgh-fringe-reviews/laura-solon-rabbit-faced-story-soup/attachment/Laura_Solon2-Edinburgh09.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>There is not a pause for breath in this story as Laura switches between the characters as well as seamlessly adding in explanatory notes about the characters while rushing about the stage. The comedy is not a bunch of jokes with punchlines but a tale of a woman with a problem on a mission to find an author to finish a novel that will sell a million. There is a lot of laughs as character flaws become visible and Laura kept the audience riveted throughout the performance. Oh, and the rabbit makes an appearance but I don&#8217;t want to give anything away.</p>


	<p>So if you&#8217;re looking for a show that tells you a tale with a bunch of mad characters, and is not just a series of jokes or unlinked sketches, then i can heartily recommend Laura for a scary tale.</p>

<p>This is an improvised series of sketches set in a share house starring a team of six actors, three male and three female. Each scene starts with a cast member asking for a suggestion from the audience and the results can depend on how well the suggestions can be integrated into the sketch. Some of the sketches worked really well, with the cast members firing off bad jokes in all directions, but some of the scenes didn&#8217;t work quite as well. This is where skill and practice comes into play and the cast, while doing a good job, really seemed to be struggling to find punch lines at times.</p>


	<p style="float:right"><img src="/articles/2009/08/09/2009-edinburgh-fringe-reviews/scenes-from-communal-living/attachment/scenes%20from%20communal%20living.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>The audience were not very animated and it was difficult getting suggestions at times, which is not a good sign at an improv show. But on the whole the team were animated and entertaining and, if you like improv and need a mid afternoon laugh, grab ticket. Just be ready to suggest something.</p>
